  <h2>About Lesskeys</h2>
  <p>LessKeys is a multi-lock system aimed at apartment buildings. The project was started by three students during research for their bachelor thesis at the University of Innsbruck.<br/>
    It's aimed to be a basic and simple implementation of a smart-lock system, designed for multi-apartment buildings with respect to the privacy and security aspects that come with such a use-case. The goal of the project is to provide a basic pattern for developing such a system.<br/>
    During development the focus was on user privacy and the usage of the "Near Field Communication" standard (NFC).<br/>
    The project itself is devided into four essential components. Those are the android app, the server application, the lock software and the web-app.

      <h3>Server</h3>
      <p>An application designed as a communication point between the different tiers, while also functioning as the central data storage in combination with a SQL-based db.<br\>
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm-3">
      <h3>App</h3>
      <p>The application serves as the central control element of the system for appartment owners, property managers and tenants. <br />
        The most important functionalities of the LessKeys app are the interaction with NFC chips, the key function of the smartphone and authorization management and lock control.<br />

      <h3>Lock</h3>
      <p>A program suited to run on a Raspberry Pi with special Modules, like a PN532 NFC reader, etc.<br/>
        Together with a 5V relais, the SoC can function as a controller for an electric door lock.
